# Vega

[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/rust-lang/rust.svg)]()

This is a web application for a vehicle dealer called Vega. If someone wants to sell his car then he needs to call Vega and ask them to register his car in their database. Other people who are buyers can browse the vehicles in their database. If they are interested in a vehicle they will call Vega and talk to someone on the phone and rest of the process happens offline.

In the home page we can see all the vehicles present in the database. We can filter and sort vehicles. If there are more than 10 vehicles they are displayed in pages. We can click a vehicle to see itsâ€™ details. There is also a page to add a new vehicle to the database.
#### Authorization
There are two roles:
* **Moderator**: They are Vega personnel who talk to sellers and buyers on the phone. They can create update and delete vehicles in the database.
* **Admin**: Anyone in this role has additional privileges. They can view reports of vehicle sales by their makes(like BMW,AUDI etc) in a pie chart. 
Anyone who has not logged in can only browse through the vehicles.
